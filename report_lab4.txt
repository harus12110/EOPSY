---------- [ Introduction ] ----------

In this lab we are to get familiar with paged memory management with the use of MOSS
Memory Management Simulator. 8 First pages of virtual memory will be mapped to physical memory 
and we'll read from an address on each of the 64 virtual pages. This will show us the behaviour 
of page faults and the page replacement algorithm. 

---------- [ Page replacement algorithm used ] ----------

By checking the source files we can find in "PageFault.java" that the default page replacement 
algorithm is first-in first-out (FIFO). That means all pages in the memory are kept in a queue 
(with the oldesst page at the front), and if there in a need for a page to be replaced, the front 
of the queue is selected. 

---------- [ Comments ] ----------

After assigning the first 8 virtual memory pages to physical memory pages we turn on MOSS
(but not yet run it) and we can check by clicking on page 0-7 buttons that the physical memory
pages were mapped correctly. The other virtual memory pages up to page 31 have been mapped 
automatically by the program.   

Trying to read the pages up to page 31 all goes well, but then we reach page 32 which means we are trying
to reference a virtual memory page which does not have a physical memory page mapped. This results in a 
page fault. The situation is the same for all pages >31. Since our page replacement algorithm is FIFO
the page to get replaced is the oldest one, in our case the one that was mapped to virtual memory
page 0, as it was the first one read and thus was in the front of the in the queue. After that 
we go in order and see what was mapped to virtual memory page number 1, 2, 3 and so on and repeat the process.
We finish in a situation in which the original mapping between virtual and physical pages has been shifted by
32, and we have read from all 64 virtual pages adresses'.
